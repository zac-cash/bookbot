# bookbot

BookBot is my first https://www.boot.dev project!  

***
Script expects a .\books\ directory.
- Inside should a frankenstein.txt file.
- You can a copy of this file here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt
- Try not to judge this work too harshly. This is my first project in python.
